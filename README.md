# ArtificialEasel

## Description

A generative NFT art platform leveraging a novel fusion of GANs and VQ-VAE, with real-time style transfer capabilities and on-chain provenance verification via zk-SNARKs.

## Features

- Here are 7 technical features for the ArtificialEasel software project:
- "Utilizes generative adversarial networks (GANs) to create realistic brushstroke simulations",
- "Supports realtime style transfer between images using convolutional neural networks (CNNs)",
- "Provides an extensible plugin architecture for integrating custom artistic algorithms and models",
- "Leverages GPU acceleration to enable fast and efficient image processing and rendering",
- "Offers advanced color palette management with support for custom color spaces and profiles",
- "Includes a machine learningbased image segmentation tool for automatic subject extraction",
- "Features a webbased API for seamless integration with other creative applications and services"
- Let me know if you'd like me to adjust or add anything!
